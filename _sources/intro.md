# Welcome to the Visible Nature Atlas on grasses and sedges of Montserrat

This is the second publication of the a visible nature atlas. With the visible nature atlas series
we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the flora and fauna or specific region. 
Sometimes focused on a specific group of organisms, sometimes on a specific region.

This visible nature atlas is focused on the grasses and sedges of Montserrat.

The data is collected from publically, open and freely available rich data sources that collect
data on the biodiversity of Montserrat. The data is then processed and visualized in a way that it 
becomes accessible to a broad audience.
